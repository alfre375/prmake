            Red started to tell a story. Red started: "When I was a sapling, I was just 1 human year, and Maeve planted me, I was still to be named, I had no proffession," Red said.
            </br>
            Everyone gasped, especially the baby opposums. Now she was talking to everyone, let alone Samar and Stephen, to help make their wish come true, this was the world!! Francesca kept her mouth wide open, and felt guilty of what she had said about Red not being able to talk.
            </br>
            Red continued: "Maeve got me as a seed, and planted me. When I was 28, I became a local celebrity, a wishtree.
            Wishtrees at the time were rare, and I'd only just meet my friend Bongo"
            Bongo cawed.
            He had become a celebrity when she was 28 1/3 human years, but it rounds to 28.
